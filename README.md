# model3-RPi4
Files required to run Supermodel the Sega Model 3 emulator under Batocera Linux.

For some reason I cannot build Supermodel on an x86 machine for the Raspberry Pi 4.
You can however build it on the RPi4 directly.
This is the resulting binary & associated files built on a RPI4 running Ubuntu 21.10.

Batocera will now grab these files to install during the RPi4 build process.

Note: The binary is modified to run specifically with Batocera Linux v33 or later.

The original source code is available here:
